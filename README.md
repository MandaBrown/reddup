# Reddup

A program to help keep things tidy.

I like to keep my computer neat and organized: code changes committed, branches pushed, downloads in the correct place, etc.

Reddup helps me make this cleanup process easy to do, so that I do it more often, and also know when I need to do it.

# commands

stack build

stack exec reddup

stack install
